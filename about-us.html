    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <div class="story">
    <p>In the tapestry of our high school days, fate wove a tale of diverse 
        passions and unexpected connections. It all began in the hallowed 
        halls of Latin class, where conjugating verbs and deciphering ancient 
        texts ignited an unspoken bond. Just as in the words of Seneca, 
        <i>Amor tussisque non celantur</i>, our love, like a cough, was not hidden. 
        As fate would have it, the anime club became our sanctuary, where shared laughter
        and whispered discussions deepened our connection. Amidst the vibrant tales on the 
        screen, our limited knowledge of Japanese was dissolved by the presence 
        of subtitles, which bridged the linguistic gap and added to the magic. We didn't 
        understand the show, but we understood each other, and we couldn't care for anything more. 
        Alongside these adventures, the world of rocketry united us in the pursuit 
        of scientific exploration and engineering marvels. From Latin class to the 
        anime club and into the boundless skies, our love story unfolded, reminding 
        us that destiny weaves its threads in the most unexpected ways, guiding us to 
        find love, friendship, and shared dreams in the most extraordinary of places.</p>
